        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta Vodka is one of those recipes that doesn’t require 
            much in the way of ingredients, many of which you may have 
            in your cupboards already. Vodka sauce has a distinct taste 
            and one that is very comforting. Think of it as an adult 
            mac n cheese!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>½ shallot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 small garlic clove, finely grated</li>
            <li>½ cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vodka</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound fusilli</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 ounce finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, 
                stirring occasionally, until al dente... 
                <strong>meanwhile</strong></li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add shallot and 
                garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 
                about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until 
                paste is brick red and starts to caramelize, about 5 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Add vodka and cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is 
                mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cream and red pepper flakes and stir until well 
                blended. Season with salt and pepper; remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Drain your pasta, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>Add pasta to skillet with sauce along with butter and ½ cup 
                pasta cooking liquid. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring 
                constantly and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, 
                until butter has melted and a thick, glossy sauce has formed, 
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper and add 1 oz. Parmesan, tossing 
                to coat. Divide pasta among bowls, then top with basil and 
                more Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
