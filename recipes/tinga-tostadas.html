        <h1>Tinga Tostadas</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here's everything you could possibly want on your chicken tostadas (and then some): 
            smoky, spicy tomato salsa, bacon-y refried beans, and a smattering of cilantro and 
            cheese. Use skin-on, bone-in, chicken breasts—they’re juicier and more flavorful 
            than their skinless, boneless counterparts—and if you prefer mild heat, reduce the 
            adobo sauce to 1 tablespoon.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium white onion</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 7-oz. can chipotle chiles in adobo</li>
            <li>1 15-oz. can fire-roasted tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. chili powder</li>
            <li>2 skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts (about 1½ lb. total)</li>
            <li>4 oz. smoked bacon</li>
            <li>2 15-oz. cans black beans</li>
            <li>8 tostadas</li>
            <li>4 oz. queso fresco</li>
            <li>¾ cup cilantro</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, prep the spicy tomato sauce: Peel and finely chop 1 medium white onion; 
                set aside ½ cup for serving. Transfer half of remaining chopped onion to a large 
                saucepan (you’ll use the rest of the onion for the beans). Peel and finely chop 
                4 garlic cloves. Transfer to saucepan. Finely chop 1 chipotle chile and transfer 
                to saucepan. (You can store any remaining chiles individually in the freezer to 
                use for later.)</li>
            <li>Add 1 15-oz. can fire-roasted tomatoes, 2 Tbsp. chili powder, and 2 Tbsp. adobo 
                sauce (use 1 Tbsp. if you're sensitive to heat) to saucepan, stir to combine, and 
                bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Nestle 2 skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts into 
                mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and bring liquid to a simmer. Cover saucepan and 
                cook until chicken is cooked through and shreds easily with two forks, 25–35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the beans: Slice 4 oz. smoked bacon into thin strips about ¼" wide and 
                transfer to a large skillet. Add remaining chopped onion and cook over medium heat, 
                stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered, bacon is crispy, and onion is browned 
                and tender, 8–10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase to medium-high and add 2 15-oz. cans black beans and their liquid (that's 
                right—don't drain them!). Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until 
                liquid is reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using a potato masher (or a wooden spoon, if you're in a pinch), smash beans until 
                almost no whole beans remain and mixture is thick, smooth, and creamy, like the 
                consistency of sour cream. Remove from heat, taste and season with salt if necessary, 
                and let cool slightly; the refried beans will thicken as they sit.</li>
            <li>When chicken is finished cooking, use tongs to transfer to a plate and let cool slightly. 
                While chicken cools, increase heat to medium-high and simmer sauce, uncovered and stirring 
                occasionally, until it looks like a thick and chunky salsa, about 5 minutes. Let cool 
                slightly in pan.</li>
            <li>Remove skin from chicken breasts and separate meat from bones; discard skin and bones. 
                Shred meat into small pieces and transfer to a medium bowl. Pour warm salsa over chicken, 
                season with 1½ tsp. salt, and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Assemble your tostadas: Use your hands to crumble 4 oz. queso fresco into small pieces 
                (about the size of dried lentils).</li>
            <li>Spread about ⅓ cup refried beans over 1 tostada. Top with about ½ cup chicken tinga.</li>
            <li>Repeat with as many tostadas as you think you’ll eat (the separate components will keep 
                well in the fridge). Top with queso fresco, cilantro, and reserved chopped onion.</li>
        </ol>
